# Path-Finding

This project implements **A\*** and **Dijkstra’s** algorithms to find the shortest path on a grid, optimized using a precomputed heuristic function for A\*.

---

##  Features
- **C++ implementation** with no external dependencies—pure, easy-to-understand code.
- Supports **Dijkstra’s algorithm** for guaranteed shortest path.
- Includes **A\*** with a **precomputed heuristic** to speed up pathfinding.
- Designed for clarity and learning—ideal for students or developers exploring pathfinding algorithms.

---

##  Files
- `main.cpp` — Contains the entry point and setup for running the pathfinding algorithms.
- `Pathfinder.cbp`, `Pathfinder.layout` — Project files for Code::Blocks (optional; for IDE setup).

---

##  Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in **Code::Blocks**, or compile manually using a C++ compiler.
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o pathfinder
